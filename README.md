# SandBox NextLab — Zainea Bogdan

This repository serves as my personal **sandbox environment** for experimenting with the **NextLab tutorial series**, used as course material in the **Web Technologies** subject of my university curriculum.

It’s a place where I practice, test, and document my progress as I move through each seminar, focusing on building a solid foundation in web development concepts.

## Progress by Seminar

### Seminar 1 — Introduction

- Learned how to set up a project using **Git** and **GitHub** for version control.
- Installed and configured **Node.js** and **Express** from the command line.
- Built a simple **Node.js server** and created custom **GET requests** to interact with it locally.

- Learned how to use **arrow functions** for cleaner syntax.
- Practiced **control flow structures** in JavaScript, including:
  - `if` statements
